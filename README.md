# Εξέδρα Engine

## Description

A 2D game engine written in C# for use in my games that I'm releasing to the public. (Runs in dotnet core)

## Run

To run the game, run `dotnet run` in a terminal

Requires SFML.net nuget package

## Credits

For fun I use Link from the Legend of Zelda Minish Cap. That sprite as well as the character itself are owned by Nintendo

I want to make clear that I use these sprites not in a professional capacity, and used them for the sake of example
