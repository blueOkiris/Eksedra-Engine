# Εξέδρα Engine

## Description

A 2D game engine written in C# for use in my games that I'm releasing to the public. (Runs in dotnet core)

It is inspired by the style of game development shown in Gamemaker 7, 8, and 8.1, but is only code, not a GUI.

## Run

To run the test game, open a terminal in the test folder and run `dotnet run`

To build the library, open a terminal in the EksedraEngine folder and run `dotnet build`

Requires SFML.net nuget package

## Credits

For fun I use Link from the Legend of Zelda Minish Cap. That sprite as well as the character itself are owned by Nintendo

I want to make clear that I use these sprites not in a professional capacity, and used them for the sake of example
